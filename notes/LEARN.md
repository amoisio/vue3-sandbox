## [This](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#from-cdn-or-without-a-bundler) article speaks of **templates**.

What are these templates? Components? Something else?

ANSWER:
"If you need to compile templates on the client (e.g. passing a string to the template option, or mounting to an element using its in-DOM HTML as the template), you will need the compiler and thus the full build"

```javascript
// this requires the compiler
Vue.createApp({
  template: '<div>{{ hi }}</div>'
})

// this does not
Vue.createApp({
  render() {
    return Vue.h('div', {}, this.hi)
  }
})
```

When using vue-loader, templates inside *.vue files are pre-compiled into JavaScript at build time. You donâ€™t really need the compiler in the final bundle, and can therefore use the runtime-only build.

## Directives

Prefixed with `v-`. They apply special reactive behavious to the rendered DOM.
